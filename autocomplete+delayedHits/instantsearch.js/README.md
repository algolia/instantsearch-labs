# Example

## Description

### What
An experimental UX which combines autocomplete and instant search, but delays the the instant search results by a few hundred milliseconds of your choosing

### Why
Requested by a client because delaying the instant search results limits visual noise and allows users to better understand what is going on

### How
A custom instant search widget that integrates autocomplete.js with a query suggestions index as the source.
