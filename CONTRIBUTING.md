# How to Contribute

## Convention

This repository respect a structure following this particular convention:

* Experimentation name
  * InstantSearch.js
    * src
    * README.md
    * ...
  * React InstantSearch
  * Vue InstantSearch
  * Angular InstantSearch

⚠️ **Warning:** You’re not force to add a version for every flavor of InstantSearch. If it's a new one, just add the flavor(s) you cover.

## Getting Started

To help you get started we provide templates that runs in codesandbox and that you can re-use.

* [InstantSearch.js](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/algolia/instantsearch-templates/tree/master/src/InstantSearch.js)
* [React InstantSearch](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/algolia/instantsearch-templates/tree/master/src/React%20InstantSearch)
* [Angular InstantSearch](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/algolia/instantsearch-templates/tree/master/src/Angular%20InstantSearch) (TODO)
* [Vue InstantSearch](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/algolia/instantsearch-templates/tree/master/src/Vue%20InstantSearch) (TODO)

Once you opened the template on codesandbox, you can easily download it and start hacking!
